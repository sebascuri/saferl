<armin> Create two environments: Inverted Pendulum, Half Cheetah, Safe Gym ?.
x Create extra costs entry for datapoints.
x Create data collection/interaction pipelines that log the costs.
x Create an utility that given rewards and costs it concatenates them into a vector.
<done> Create multi-output Q functions.
<done> Create a model for costs besides constraints as well as learning algorithms.
<seb> Lagrangian Cost reduction (vector)
- Shooting + Rejection sampling baseline.
