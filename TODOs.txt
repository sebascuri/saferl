TODOs:

- Create two environments: Inverted Pendulum, Half Cheetah, Safe Gym ?. 
- Create extra costs entry for datapoints.
- Create data collection/interaction pipelines that log the costs. 
- Create an utility that given rewards and costs it concatenates them into a vector.
- Create multi-output Q functions. 
- Create a model for costs besides constraints as well as learning algorithms. 
- Shooting + Rejection sampling baseline.
